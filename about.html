  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to TechBros — where passion meets innovation. We're not your average tech crew. We're a tight-knit group of creatives, developers, and gamers who believe technology isn't just a tool — it's a lifestyle. Whether it's building stunning websites, diving into the latest games, or sharing valuable tips with our community, we do it all with purpose and precision.
  </p>

  <p>
    TechBros was born from late-night coding sessions, shared controller battles, and a shared dream to make something different. We noticed the gap — the lack of platforms that blend tech culture with gaming energy — so we filled it. From day one, our mission has been clear: <strong>create, connect, and inspire.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Our team is built on trust, creativity, and a shared love for digital greatness. We’ve spent hours perfecting our craft, learning from failures, and celebrating every tiny win. Whether you're here for web development inspiration, gaming content, or just to vibe with us — you're in the right place.
